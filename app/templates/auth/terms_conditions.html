  <h1>Kushwell Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <div class="section" id="mission">
    <h2>1. Mission Statement & Ethical Principles</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>Kushwell</strong>, integrity and transparency guide every decision we make. We never accept
      payment, sponsorship, or incentives of any kind for product placement, promotion, or review. All
      recommendations provided by our platform and AI tools are based solely on verified customer feedback
      collected through our wellness check-ins and patient-driven reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to empower patients and consumers with data-driven, unbiased insights so they can make
      informed and compassionate decisions about their health and well-being. We do not sell products,
      nor are we affiliated with any entities that do. Every rating, ranking, and suggestion emerges from
      **patient experience and statistical analysis**, free from financial influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kushwell exists to remove politics and marketing influence from the conversation around cannabis,
      replacing it with science, math, and patient-driven insight. Our goal is to deliver accurate,
      unbiased, and actionable information that helps individuals make the best decisions for themselves
      and their families.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="independence">
    <h2>2. Independence & Financial Neutrality</h2>
    <p>
      Kushwell is wholly independent. We are not owned by, partnered with, or compensated by any cannabis
      company, dispensary, supplier, or marketing organization. We do not promote products for profit, nor
      do we accept payment for any recommendations. Our independence ensures that all insights, guidance,
      and product assessments remain **completely unbiased**.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every recommendation you receive through Kushwell reflects **real patient experience, statistical
      analysis, and scientific reasoning** — nothing more. This neutrality is fundamental to our mission
      and core to the trust placed in us by our patients.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="data-driven">
    <h2>3. Data-Driven Patient Focus</h2>
    <p>
      Recommendations and insights are generated through rigorous data collection and analysis. Kushwell
      leverages AI and statistical modeling to ensure suggestions are based on real-world outcomes and
      patient feedback, not commercial influence.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Patient votes determine product ranking.</li>
      <li>Statistical models identify benefits for specific afflictions.</li>
      <li>Grassroots contributions from patients help maintain a robust product catalog.</li>
      <li>All insights are continuously updated based on new patient input.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="security">
    <h2>4. Security & Privacy (HIPAA Compliance)</h2>
    <p>
      Kushwell is committed to protecting your privacy. We maintain full HIPAA compliance and employ
      state-of-the-art encryption, segmented databases, and zero-trust architecture to safeguard your
      personal health information (PHI). All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may operate under an alias, which keeps your real name and identity private. Aliases and
      personal information are stored in separate, randomized database layers that cannot be
      cross-referenced without your explicit consent. No one — including other patients, providers,
      or our team — can access your identity unless you choose to reveal it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, your data at Kushwell is more protected than in many hospital systems, and our platform
      ensures that **patient anonymity and confidentiality** are preserved at all times.
